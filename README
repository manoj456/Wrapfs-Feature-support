I have first made all the EA working for wrapfs and then kept all conditions specified as below:


TASK 1::

I created a test.txt file for checking all conditions


For Some other extra EA :

        setfattr -n "user.md5sum" -v 1 test.txt
        getfattr -d test.txt

        Result for test.txt file ::  user.md5sum='1';

        setfattr -n "user.md5sum" -v 0 test.txt
        getfattr -d test.txt

        Result for test.txt file ::  user.md5sum='0';
        Kept conditions for normal flow execution

For Integrity_val EA :

        setfattr -n "user.integrity_val" -v 1 test.txt
        setfattr -n "user.integrity_val" -v 0 test.txt
        setfattr -x "user.integrity_val" test.txt

        For both operations operation is not supported.
        I kept a condition for that not accesing "user.integrity_val" directly in both setxattr and removexattr functions in xattr.c file

For Has_integrity EA :

        setfattr -n "user.has_integrity" -v 0 test.txt

        No Integrity_val is set

        setfattr -n "user.has_integrity" -v 0 test.txt

        Integrity_val is set

        Kept conditions in setxattr function in xattr.c file accordingly


        If again, has_integrity is set to 0 ,then Integrity_val successfully removed.


        I kept conditions in my setxattr amd removexattr functions so that Integrity_val is removed for removal of has_integrity

For has_integrity value size checks :

        setfattr -n "user.has_integrity" -v 10 test.txt
        operation not supported and appropriate printk message logged

        setfattr -n "user.has_integrity" -v 3 test.txt
        operation not supported and appropriate printk message logged

Access conditions :

        Kept conditions for allowing only root users to change has_integrity and Non root users can only query it in setxattr and removexattr funcs in xattr.c file

Wrapfs_open conditions :

        created file test.txt and set has_integrity set to 1 so that integrity_val is also set.
        Now when i modified the file the content is changed.

        If i didn't update my check sum before closing the file (remove thecondition i keep in wrapfs_close function)
        then if i try to open the same file then it shows permission denied and file is not opening.

Wrapfs_close conditions :

        I kept condition so that everytime i close the file integrity is updated for modified content.
        Never throws permission denied as file content modified has been noted and integrity updated.

        File opens successfully.

Trunacate Condition:

        cat>test.txt
        content replaced  and new integrity set everytime and successfully working.

Only Regular Files condition :

        setfattr -n "user.has_integrity" -v 1 directory
        setfattr -n "user.has_integrity" -v 0 directory

        No check sum calculated in any case as its directory.
        kept IS_DIR condition in setxattr func in xattr.c file


TASK 2:

        cd directory ->has_integrity is '0'

        Files inside it
                cat>test1.txt ->doesn't get any has_integrity or integrity_val

        cd directory ->has_integrity is '1'

        Files inside it
                cat>test2.txt ->Both has_integrity and integrity_val are set.



COMMANDS THAT I FOLLOWED TO EXECUTE :

        If any reboot   - mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /n/scratch/ -o user_xattr
                          mount -t wrapfs /n/scratch/ /tmp/

        In wrapfs folder    -  umount /tmp

        In hw2-mtammali folder- make
                                make modules;make modules_install;make install

        Again In Wrapfs folder- rmmod wrapfs
                                insmod wrapfs.ko
                                mount -t wrapfs /n/scratch/ /tmp/
